  "intro": "In July 2016, Jaakko Hellerante and I set out for the Calais Jungle, of one of the largest refugee camps in Europe. Our goal was to help MapFugees, a Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team, complete a basemap of the camp using Mapillary photos. As we collected street-level photos of the camp to edit OpenStreetMap, we captured snapshots of life in the Jungle, where over 7,000 people live without calling it home. ",

On the morning I arrived, service was in full-swing, you could hear the singing as you approached from the path. People were clustered in front of the altar, but many sat in the pews, some with their heads in their hands. No cameras allowed during service."
